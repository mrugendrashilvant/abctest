Title: Creating a Google Page with Search and Dynamic Word Highlighting

Introduction:
This case study aims to assess your skills in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a Google-like search page that dynamically highlights words based on user input. You will be provided with an array of words, and your task is to implement a search functionality that highlights the words as the user types characters of a word. This exercise will test your understanding of HTML structure, style sense, JavaScript event handling, and manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model).

Requirements:
Create an HTML page that resembles the basic layout and design of a Google search page. Toggle between light and dark mode is a plus. (Refer: https://www.google.com/)
Implement a search input field where users can enter their search query.
Use the array of words provided below for the search functionality.
As the user starts typing in the search input, dynamically display the matching words from the array below the search input.
Highlight the characters that the user typed in the input field.
Sample Array:
const wordsArray = ["apple", "appa", "banana", "cherry", "mango", "orange", "strawberry", "watermelon"];

Submission:
Create a public github repo and host it using netlify or any free hosting services you prefer, attach the link in project readme and share the github repo with us.

Conclusion:
This case study evaluates your ability to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a Google-like search page with dynamic word highlighting. By completing this task, you will demonstrate proficiency in working with arrays, handling user input, and manipulating the DOM. Good luck with your implementation!
